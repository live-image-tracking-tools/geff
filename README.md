GEFF is a specification for a file format for **exchanging** spatial graph data. It is not intended to be mutable, editable, chunked, or optimized for use in an application setting.

This repository contains two packages:
- `geff-spec` is the specification of GEFF metadata written with `pydantic` `BaseModels` which are exported to a json schema for use in other languages.
- `geff` is the python library that reads and writes GEFF files to and from several python in-memory graph data structures (`networkx`, `rustworkx` and `spatial-graph`).

Learn more in the [documentation](https://live-image-tracking-tools.github.io/geff/latest/) or check out the [source code](https://github.com/live-image-tracking-tools/geff).
